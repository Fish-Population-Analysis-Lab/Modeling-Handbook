# Onboarding

::: callout-important
## Group Edit

This is most easily edited by someone actively going through the onboarding process (or someone who recently joined the lab group).
That being said, here are some discussion questions to get you started:

-   How long is "onboarding"?
    When can you say it is over and someone has completed it?

-   What do you feel was most difficult when you first joined the lab?
    What tips would you want to pass along to someone on their first day, first week, etc.

-   Who are the people to talk to in your department/college who hold the knowledge a newcomer might need to get settled in?
    E.g. who does payroll, who can get you a spare monitor and keyboard, who can get you key card access, etc.

-   What are good ways to get to know people (personally and professionally) in your lab group/department/school/college?

We expect this checklist to be constantly evolving and encourage you to edit it as *part of onboarding*.
