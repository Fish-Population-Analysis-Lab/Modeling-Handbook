We create our culture, and in the Fish Population Lab, our culture is inclusive.\nWe value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure an that every lab member and collaborator has a positive, educational experience unhindered by unnecessary challenges caused by non-inclusive behavior. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Fish Population Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times.\nEl hadji Ndiaye as head of the Fish Population Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone.

We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form.\nWe are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who has experienced discrimination in the past.\nTo make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.\nUnacceptable behavior includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nMembers of the community who violate these rules—no matter how much they have contributed to the Fish Population Lab, or how specialized their skill set—will be approached by El hadji Ndiaye. If inappropriate behavior persists after a discussion with El hadji Ndiaye, the issue will be escalated according to procedures laid out by the relevant entities in University of Arizona’s Office of Institutional Equity\nTo report an issue please contact El hadji Ndiaye.
